# IoT Garbage Collection Sign
A simple sign that indicates whether the trash and/or recycling is being collected tomorrow by blinking a light for each. 
The lights will stop blinking when the button on the side is pressed. If an error is encountered while retrieving the trash
schedule the blinking lights will alternate rapidly.
